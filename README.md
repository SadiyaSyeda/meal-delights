# meal-delights

### Project Overview

MealDelights is a Swift-based iOS app that allows users to browse and view detailed information about various meals, particularly focusing on desserts. The app is designed with a robust architecture that leverages Swift Concurrency (async/await), modular view models, and a flexible network client architecture. The UI is built using SwiftUI, with custom view modifiers to enhance the design.

### Key Features

-   **Network Requests**: The app fetches meal data from an external API.
-   **Meal Categories**: Displays a list of meal categories.
-   **Desserts**: Users can browse a list of desserts and view details about each.
-   **Custom View Modifiers**: Uses  `CustomTitleModifier`  and  `CustomCardModifier`  for consistent styling across the app.
-   **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for view models, network interactions, and data parsing.
-   **Preview Support**: SwiftUI views have preview configurations to visualize UI changes during development.

### App Architecture

1.  **View Models**:
    
    -   **MealCategoriesViewModel**: Manages fetching and displaying meal categories.
    -   **DessertViewModel**: Handles fetching dessert listings and managing their state.
    -   **DessertDetailsViewModel**: Responsible for fetching details of a selected dessert.
    
    Each view model interacts with the  `NetworkClient`  to fetch data, handles error states, and processes results for the UI.
    
2.  **Network Client**:
    
    -   The  `NetworkClient`  is responsible for making asynchronous network requests. It is decoupled from the view models through protocols to allow flexible injection and easy testing.
    -   A  **MockNetworkClient**  is used for unit testing network-related functionality.
3.  **Custom View Modifiers**:
    
    -   `CustomTitleModifier`: Applies a consistent title style to  `Text`  views.
    -   `CustomCardModifier`: Adds padding, background, shadow, and border styles to views, useful for cards displaying content.

### Testing

-   **Unit Tests**:
    -   **DessertViewModelTests**: Ensures proper fetching of meals, handling of network errors, and data sorting.
    -   **DessertDetailsViewModelTests**: Verifies the fetching of dessert details, including invalid data handling.
    -   **MealCategoriesViewModelTests**: Tests fetching meal categories, handling errors, and filtering invalid categories.
-   **Mock Network Client**: A mock implementation of  `NetworkClientProtocol`  simulates network responses, allowing for predictable and isolated tests.


### How to Run the App

1.  Clone the repository and open it in Xcode.
2.  Run the project using the iOS simulator or a physical device.
3.  Tests can be run via the  `Test Navigator`  or using  `⌘ + U`.

### How to Run Tests

1.  Open the project in Xcode.
2.  Select  `Product -> Test`  or use the  `⌘ + U`  shortcut.
3.  All tests, including network-related ones with mock clients, will run, and the results will be displayed.

### Project Structure

-   **Models**: Contains data models such as  `MealCategory`,  `Meal`, and  `DessertDetail`.
-   **View Models**: Holds view models like  `DessertViewModel`,  `MealCategoriesViewModel`, and  `DessertDetailsViewModel`.
-   **Views**: SwiftUI views for displaying meals, categories, and meal details.
-   **Tests**: Unit tests for view models and network interactions using mock data.

### Preview Configuration

The SwiftUI views come with preview setups, allowing you to see how the UI looks with different meal data. These previews are located within each SwiftUI view file.

### Custom Styling

The project uses  `ViewModifier`  extensions to maintain a consistent and reusable style throughout the app:

-   `customTitleStyle()`: Applies a title style to  `Text`  views.
-   `customCardStyle()`: Provides a card-like appearance to views, including rounded corners, shadows, and a border.
